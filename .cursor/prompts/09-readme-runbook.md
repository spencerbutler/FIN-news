## Goal
Write a practical README that enables a user to install, run, and operate the dashboard reliably.

## Constraints
- Assume Windows + macOS/Linux.
- Keep it simple; no marketing.
- Include troubleshooting for common RSS issues.

## Requirements
README sections:
1. What this is / what it is not
2. Quickstart (venv + pip + run)
3. Configuration (env vars)
4. Data model at a glance
5. Operating notes (retention, health)
6. Troubleshooting:
   - feeds returning empty
   - bozo feeds / parse errors
   - sqlite locked / WAL mode
7. License and contribution notes (optional)

## Output
- `README.md` updated
